I'm a Toronto-based developer with experience in writing finance and tax software. As a recent master's graduate in Computer Engineering (June 2020), I focused primarily on applications of machine learning and data science. I'm currently working as a freelance developer writing financial analysis and accounting software for my clients. I primarily work with Python and various data science libraries, and occasionally C++, Java, and SQL when extending existing services. Besides my work experience and education, I'm also a self-taught web developer. The main frameworks and languages I work with are React, Express, and Node. Web development is a rapidly evolving field, so I'm always open to learning new technologies.

Outside of software development, I enjoy photography, cooking, playing guitar, and occasionally dabbling in art. I'm a strong proponent of self-learning, so a good chunk of my time is spent reading non-fiction or brushing up on my programming skills.
