I'm a Toronto-based developer with experience in writing finance and tax software. I earned my master's degree in Computer Engineering in mid-2020, where I focused primarily on applications of machine learning and data science. I'm currently working as a freelance developer during the **Covid-19** outbreak, writing finance and tax software for my clients.

As a self-taught web developer, the main technologies I work with are JavaScript and HTML/CSS, plus the React, Express, and Node frameworks. For work beyond the web, I primarily use Python and various data science libraries.

Outside of software development, I'm an avid cook and a frequent patron of the gym. I enjoy photography, playing guitar, and occasionally dabbling in art. I'm a strong proponent of self-learning, so a good chunk of my time is spent reading (non-fiction), or brushing up on my programming skills.
