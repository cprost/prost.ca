I'm a Toronto-based developer with experience in writing finance and tax software. As a recent master's graduate in Computer Engineering (June 2020), I focused primarily on applications of machine learning and data science. I'm currently working as a freelance developer during the **Covid-19** outbreak, writing finance and tax software for my clients. Besides my work experience and education, I'm also a self-taught web developer. The main technologies I work with are JavaScript and HTML/CSS, plus the React, Express, and Node frameworks. For work beyond the web, I primarily use Python and various data science libraries.

Outside of software development, I'm an avid cook and a frequent patron of the gym. I enjoy photography, playing guitar, and occasionally dabbling in art. I'm a strong proponent of self-learning, so a good chunk of my time is spent reading (non-fiction), or brushing up on my programming skills.
